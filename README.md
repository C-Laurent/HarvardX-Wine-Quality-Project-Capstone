# HarvardX-Wine-Quality-Project-Capstone

Estimated at USD 326.6 Billion in the year 2020, the global market for Wine is projected to reach a revised size of US$434.6 Billion by 2027 (ref: Global Wine Industry report(https://www.reportlinker.com/p05010580/Global-Wine-Industry.html?utm_source=GNW). As one can expect, finding the right formula to make "good" wines has always been a key stake for wine makers. And considering the increasing number of wine makers and wines over time, this question has become all the more important also for wine consumers. Beyond the wine origin, grapes and even color, which are often used for promotion, one can decide to focus on the chemical components of wine to predict the wine quality.

For this project, we will create a model to predict the wine quality based on a set of 11 attributes detailing the physicochemical properties of a selection of wines from the north of Portugal.

Since this project is also one of the 2 projects of the HervardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course, we will also try and use several models learned during the previous courses to find out which one might be the most performant.
